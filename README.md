## 📂 Dataset Description
The project uses **synthetic yet realistic datasets** containing **500 student records**.

### 👤 Students Dataset
- student_id  
- age  
- gender  
- course_id  
- dropout (0 = Active, 1 = Dropped Out)

### 📊 Engagement Dataset
- student_id  
- login_days  
- video_hours  
- forum_posts  
- attendance  

### 📝 Assessments Dataset
- student_id  
- avg_score  
- assignments_submitted

## 🗄️ Database Design (MySQL)
Three relational tables were created:
- `students`
- `engagement`
- `assessments`

Data was imported using **MySQL Workbench** and queried to identify students at risk of dropping out.

## 🔄 Project Workflow
1. Data collection and preprocessing  
2. Data storage and querying using MySQL  
3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) in Python  
4. Dropout prediction using machine learning  
5. Dashboard creation in Power BI  
6. Insight generation and recommendations

## 🤖 Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm:** Linear Regression  
- **Input Features:** login_days, video_hours, attendance, avg_score  
- **Target Variable:** dropout  
- The model predicts the probability of student dropout based on engagement and performance indicators.

## 📈 Power BI Dashboard
The interactive dashboard includes:
- Course completion rates  
- Student dropout analysis  
- Engagement vs performance trends  
- Course and instructor performance comparison  

📷 A dashboard screenshot is available in the `powerbi/` folder.

---

## 🔍 Key Insights
- Low attendance and reduced engagement strongly correlate with dropouts  
- Students with consistently low assessment scores are at higher risk  
- Early identification enables timely academic intervention  

---

## 💡 Recommendations
- Monitor engagement metrics regularly  
- Provide personalized support for at-risk students  
- Improve course structure and instructor interaction  
- Use analytics-driven alerts to reduce dropout rates
